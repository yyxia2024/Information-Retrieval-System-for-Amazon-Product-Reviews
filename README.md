# Information-Retrieval-System-for-Amazon-Product-Reviews
This project aims to develop an information retrieval system focused on retrieving pertinent information from an extensive collection of health products in response to user queries. The information retrieval system takes a user query as input and generates output documents that encompass the most relevant information based on the provided query. 

This project focuses on an exploration of two modelsâ€”BM25 and Doc2Vec. The objective is to determine which model exhibits superior performance and assess their effectiveness across different types of queries.
